# EcoNuker Public
EcoNuker's public repository, including code snippets and more!

# Code Snippets
This repository includes code snippets used in the official EcoNuker bot. We make no guarantee that these are up-to-date, but will indicate if it is. You can include these in your own bot, or you can make PRs to improve the code (and we might use it in the official bot).

# License
This repository uses a MIT license, meaning you are allowed to do whatever you want with released code snippets. This does not apply to private code snippets; if private code was leaked tell a Head Developer.
